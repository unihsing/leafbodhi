Stop WordPress from generating unnecessary additional image sizes while uploading!

== Description ==
When you upload an image using _Media Uploader_, WordPress generates multiple copies of that image. By default, WordPress generates 4 sizes-

- Thumbnail
- Medium
- Medium-large
- Large

But along with this, theme and plugin developers can register their own sizes. Although they may be on purpose, but sometimes they remain unused.

Think about it, **unnecessary additional images are eating up your server space** and **slowing down your site**!

Sounds like a problem? What is the solution then?
This is where our plugin comes into the picture. Just install the plugin and choose which of the imaze sizes you want to prevent from generating.

- Works with any plugin and theme.
- WooCommerce compatible.
- Multisite compatible.
- Super easy to install and configure.
- It's free and always will be.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `image-sizes` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress
3. Go to **Image Sizes** menu from the left and choose which of the sizes you want to prevent from generating.
